# MYNOTE Website

A Website to have all your notes together.
I used express.js for the server part and connected this to database using Mongodb.
No particular frameworks were used for the css part.Also to give the website a dynamic look I used handlebars (moustache) template engines.

You can register , login and save/delete your notes here.
